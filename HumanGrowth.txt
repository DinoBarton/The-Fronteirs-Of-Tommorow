Never before has a boy not asked for more. - My Oliver Twist on the quote. Human growth is inevitable therefore discussing human growth as a cause, factor and reason for space colonisation is inevitable. Every day, day in, day out we are trying to grow may it be physically financially, in knowledge, or in a video game you love. In our natural urge for expansion and colonisation, there have been many case studies such as this of the Polynesians and the American frontier. It would be understandable for me to say that we will eventually colonise the stars eventually due to our natural passion for growth. However, are we channeling our passion for growth in a direction that supports space colonisation? I think so, everything we do in our lives contributes to the world in some way and therefore makes our civilisation more suitable for conquering new frontiers. 

Polio was a devastating disease in the early 20th century, causing paralysis and death worldwide. Dr. Jonas Salk, developed the first effective polio vaccine in the early 1950s*. Dr. Salk developed a ‘killed’ version of polio with formaldehyde*. This ensured that the vaccine didn’t cause disease and still provided immunity*. This contribution to the world caused polio cases to decrease by 99% from 1988,* this contribution saved millions of people. Now how can a vaccine against polio aid space colonisation?
